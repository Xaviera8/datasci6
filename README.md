# datasci_6_regression

I chose this dataset as it contains a lot of numerical categories that could be used in regressions test. I used the columns wheelbase, carlength, curbweight, enginesize, horsepower, and highwaympg as I assumed these categories would have a significant impact on the price of a vehicle.
